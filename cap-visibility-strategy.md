---

## 1️⃣ Optimize GPT Store Listing (SEO)

### Name Optimization

**Recommended:**
```

```
or
```

```

**Why:** Include high-search keywords: "DSCR loans", "calculator", "investment financing"

---

### Description Optimization
**Keyword-rich and benefit-focused:**

```

5.99%, calculate DSCR ratios, learn BRRRR strategies, and qualify rental 
properties instantly. Specializing in California investment property financing

## 2️⃣ Conversation Starters (Critical for Discovery!)

### Current Starters (Good):

- "Can a DSCR loan work for my short-term rental in San Diego?"
- "Help me compare DSCR vs hard money for a BRRRR deal"
- "I want to refinance my rental portfolio with DSCR—where do I start?"

### Add These High-Search-Volume Starters:

✅ "Can I get a DSCR loan with 640 credit score?"
✅ "DSCR loan requirements and down payment"
✅ "How to finance a rental property without tax returns"
✅ "DSCR loan rates today"
```

**Why these work:**
