# ✅ Voice Chat Lead Capture - FIXED!

## 🐛 **THE PROBLEM:**

Voice chat was NOT properly capturing leads like text chat because it was trying to hack the chat API with text strings instead of proper database operations.

### **Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
// Voice chat tried this:
case 'saveLead': {
  fetch('/api/agent/chat', {
    body: {
      messages: [{
        content: `Save this lead: ${JSON.stringify(leadData)}` // ❌ Won't work!
      }]
    }
  });
  // Returns fake data: 'temp-lead-id'
}
```

**What Was Missing:**
- ❌ No actual database saves
- ❌ No lead scoring
- ❌ No email notifications
- ❌ No interaction logging
- ❌ No event tracking
- ❌ No CRM integration
- ❌ Fake lead IDs returned

**Impact:**
- Voice leads were LOST
- No follow-up emails sent
- No sales team notifications
- No way to track conversions
- **ZERO revenue from voice channel**

---

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

### **Created Dedicated Voice Tools Endpoint:**

**`/api/voice/tools/route.ts`** - Full database integration for voice chat

### **What It Does:**

#### **1. saveLead Tool** 💾
```typescript
POST /api/voice/tools
{
  tool: 'saveLead',
  args: {
    leadDraft: {
      name: "John Investor",
      email: "john@example.com",
      phone: "555-1234",
      productType: "dscr",
      // ... all other fields
    }
  }
}

Response:
{
  leadId: "clx123abc", // Real database ID
  status: "created",
  message: "Perfect! I've saved your information."
}
```

**Database Operations:**
- ✅ Check for existing lead by email/phone
- ✅ Create new or update existing lead
- ✅ Mark channel as 'voice_chat'
- ✅ Save consent timestamp
- ✅ Log interaction with full details
- ✅ Return real lead ID

---

#### **2. scoreLead Tool** 📊
```typescript
POST /api/voice/tools
{
  tool: 'scoreLead',
  args: {
    leadId: "clx123abc"
  }
}

Response:
{
  score: 85,
  disposition: "qualified",
  preliminaryOffer: {
    maxLoanAmount: $340000,
    estimatedRate: 6.49,
    maxLTV: 80
  },
  message: "Great news! You're pre-qualified with a score of 85/100."
}
```

**Database Operations:**
- ✅ Fetch lead from database
- ✅ Run scoring algorithm
- ✅ Update lead with score & status
- ✅ Save preliminary offer
- ✅ Log interaction
- ✅ Create sales alert event (if qualified)
- ✅ **Send email notification** (qualified or follow_up)

---

#### **3. scheduleCall Tool** 📅
```typescript
POST /api/voice/tools
{
  tool: 'scheduleCall',
  args: {
    leadId: "clx123abc"
  }
}

Response:
{
  meetingUrl: "https://calendar.app.google/NVzWjvMWQ5uamkw8A?utm_source=voice_ai",
  message: "Here's your scheduling link. Pick a time that works for you!"
}
```

**Database Operations:**
- ✅ Update lead status to 'follow_up'
- ✅ Create schedule event
- ✅ Track channel as voice_chat
- ✅ Log for sales team

---

#### **4. crmWebhook Tool** 🔗
```typescript
POST /api/voice/tools
{
  tool: 'crmWebhook',
  args: {
    leadId: "clx123abc",
    payload: { ... }
  }
}
```

**Database Operations:**
- ✅ Log webhook interaction
- ✅ Track for integration monitoring
