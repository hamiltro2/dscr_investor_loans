              If you're self-employed and trying to get an investment property loan, you've probably hit a frustrating wall. 
              Traditional lenders want 2 years of tax returns, detailed profit & loss statements, and they scrutinize every 
              business expense. Worse yet, all those smart tax write-offs that save you money actually hurt your loan qualification.

                  Yes, self-employed borrowers can get investment property loans through DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) 
                  loans. These loans qualify you based on the property's rental income, not your personal income. You don't 
                  need to provide tax returns, W2s, or income verification. This makes them perfect for self-employed investors 
                  who write off business expenses to reduce taxable income.

                  No, DSCR loans for investment properties do not require tax returns. This is the main advantage for 
                  self-employed borrowers. Traditional lenders require 2 years of tax returns and analyze your business 
                  income, which often shows lower income due to tax write-offs. DSCR loans only look at the property's 
                  rental income, not your personal or business tax returns.

                <p className="text-gray-400 mt-4">
                  With traditional loans, tax write-offs hurt qualification because they reduce your taxable income. Lenders 
                  see lower income and may deny your loan. With DSCR loans, tax write-offs don't matter at all. You can 
                  maximize business deductions to reduce taxes while still qualifying for investment property loans based on 
                  rental income. This lets self-employed investors have the best of both worlds.

                  loans skip all that documentation, making approval much faster. Total time from application to closing is

                  Higher scores (680+) qualify for better rates. Some lenders offer programs down to 600 with larger down 
                  payments. Credit score requirements are the same for self-employed and W2 borrowers since DSCR loans focus 
                  on property income, not personal income.
