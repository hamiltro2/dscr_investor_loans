            A 1031 exchange is one of the most powerful tax-deferral strategies for real estate investors. Combined with DSCR financing, you can sell an investment property, defer ALL capital gains taxes, and upgrade to a better-performing asset—without needing to qualify based on personal income.
          </p>

          <h2>What is a 1031 Exchange?</h2>
          <p>
            Named after Section 1031 of the IRS code, a 1031 exchange (also called a "like-kind exchange") allows you to sell an investment property and reinvest the proceeds into another investment property while deferring capital gains taxes.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Like-Kind Property:</strong> Must exchange one investment property for another (can't exchange for personal residence)</li>
            <li><strong>45-Day Identification Rule:</strong> Must identify replacement property within 45 days of selling</li>
            <li><strong>180-Day Close Rule:</strong> Must close on replacement property within 180 days</li>
            <li><strong>Equal or Greater Value:</strong> Replacement property must be equal or greater in value to defer all taxes</li>
            <li><strong>Qualified Intermediary Required:</strong> Must use a third-party intermediary to hold funds</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why DSCR Loans Are Perfect for 1031 Exchanges</h2>

          <h3>Speed</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional bank financing takes 30-45 days. DSCR loans close in 7-14 days, giving you breathing room within the 180-day window.
          </p>

          <h3>No Income Verification</h3>
          <p>
            You don't need tax returns, W-2s, or pay stubs. Perfect for investors with complex tax situations or who write off significant expenses.
          </p>

          <h3>Multiple Property Purchases</h3>
          <p>
            Want to sell one property and buy three? DSCR loans make it easy to close on multiple properties quickly.
          </p>

          <h3>Cash Flow Qualification</h3>
          <p>
            Properties qualify based on rental income, not your personal income. Ideal for investors buying better-performing assets.
          </p>

          <h2>1031 Exchange + DSCR Loan Strategy Guide</h2>

          <h3>Strategy 1: Trade Up (Bigger Property, Better Cash Flow)</h3>
          <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 my-6">
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Example:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-2">
              <li>Sell: Single-family home worth $400K</li>
              <li>Buy: Duplex worth $600K</li>
              <li>DSCR Loan: $450K at 6.99% (75% LTV)</li>
              <li>Use exchange proceeds: $400K + $50K cash to down payment</li>
              <li>New cash flow: $2,400/month vs $1,200/month</li>
              <li>Capital gains deferred: $150K</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Strategy 2: Geographic Diversification</h3>
          <p>
            Sell one property in an expensive market (like California) and buy multiple properties in cash flow markets (like Texas, Florida, Arizona).
          </p>
          <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 my-6">
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Example:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-2">
              <li>Sell: Los Angeles condo worth $800K</li>
              <li>Buy: 3 properties in Phoenix ($250K each)</li>
              <li>DSCR loans on all three (close simultaneously)</li>
              <li>Diversify risk across multiple markets</li>
              <li>Higher combined cash flow</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Strategy 3: Swap for Better Property Type</h3>
          <p>
            Exchange a traditional rental for an Airbnb/STR property with 2-3x the cash flow.
          </p>

          <h3>Strategy 4: Portfolio Consolidation</h3>
          <p>
            Sell multiple smaller properties and buy one larger multi-family property for easier management.
          </p>

          <h2>Critical Timeline Considerations</h2>

          <h3>Day 0: Sell Your Property</h3>
          <p>Qualified intermediary holds proceeds. Clock starts.</p>

          <h3>Day 1-45: Identification Period</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify up to 3 properties (or more under 200% rule)</li>
            <li>Must be in writing to qualified intermediary</li>
            <li><strong>Start DSCR pre-approval immediately!</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Day 46-180: Purchase Period</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Close on replacement property</li>
            <li>DSCR loans close in 7-14 days (huge advantage)</li>
            <li>Transfer funds through qualified intermediary</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 my-6">
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">⚠️ Pro Tip:</p>
            <p>Get DSCR pre-approval BEFORE listing your property for sale. This way you can move fast when you find replacement properties.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Common 1031 Exchange Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

          <h3>1. Waiting Too Long to Start Financing</h3>
          <p>
            Don't wait until day 40 to start loan approval. Begin immediately after sale.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Not Using a Qualified Intermediary</h3>
          <p>
            If you touch the sale proceeds, you disqualify the entire exchange. Always use a QI.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Buying a Lesser-Value Property</h3>
          <p>
            If replacement property is worth less, you'll pay taxes on the difference ("boot").
          </p>

          <h3>4. Missing Deadlines</h3>
          <p>
            The 45-day and 180-day rules are STRICT. No extensions, even for holidays or weekends.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Buying Personal Use Property</h3>
          <p>
            Replacement must be investment property. Can't exchange into your future primary residence.
          </p>

          <h2>DSCR Loan Requirements for 1031 Exchange</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> 620+ minimum (700+ for best rates)</li>
            <li><strong>Down Payment:</strong> 15-25% depending on property type</li>
            <li><strong>DSCR Ratio:</strong> 1.0+ (rental income covers mortgage payment)</li>
            <li><strong>Reserves:</strong> 6-12 months PITIA</li>
            <li><strong>Property Types:</strong> 1-4 units, condos, townhomes, SFR</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Tax Benefits Beyond Capital Gains Deferral</h2>

          <h3>Depreciation Reset</h3>
          <p>
            New property gets a fresh depreciation schedule based on higher purchase price.
          </p>

          <h3>Step-Up at Death</h3>
          <p>
            Hold until death, heirs receive stepped-up basis, taxes forgiven entirely.
          </p>

          <h3>Infinite Tax Deferral</h3>
          <p>
            Keep exchanging every 5-10 years. Never pay capital gains in your lifetime.
          </p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>Can I do a 1031 exchange on my primary residence?</h3>
          <p>
            No. 1031 exchanges are only for investment properties. For primary residences, use the Section 121 exclusion ($250K/$500K capital gains exclusion).
          </p>

          <h3>What if I can't find a replacement property in 45 days?</h3>
          <p>
            The exchange fails and you owe capital gains taxes on the sale. This is why pre-approval and quick action are critical.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I live in the replacement property later?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, but you must hold it as an investment first (typically 1-2 years minimum). Consult your CPA.
          </p>

          <h3>Do I need the same type of property?</h3>
          <p>
            No. "Like-kind" just means investment real estate. You can exchange a condo for a duplex, single-family for commercial, etc.
          </p>

          <h3>What happens if I buy a cheaper property?</h3>
          <p>
            You'll pay taxes on the difference (called "boot"). To defer 100% of taxes, replacement must be equal or greater value.
          </p>

          <h2>Action Steps to Start Your 1031 Exchange</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Contact a Qualified Intermediary:</strong> Set up before listing property</li>
            <li><strong>Get DSCR Pre-Approval:</strong> Know your buying power before you sell</li>
            <li><strong>List Your Property:</strong> Work with agent experienced in 1031s</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Replacements (Day 1-45):</strong> Have backup properties</li>
            <li><strong>Close Fast (Day 46-180):</strong> DSCR loans make this easy</li>
            <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Work with CPA familiar with 1031 rules</li>
          </ol>
