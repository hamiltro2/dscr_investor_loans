  const redditFAQs = [
    {
      q: "Can I really get a mortgage without tax returns?",
      a: "Yes! Bank statement loans use 12-24 months of business bank statements instead of tax returns. DSCR loans don't look at your income at all—they only care if the rental income covers the mortgage. These are legit programs from licensed lenders, not scams."
    },
    {
      q: "Will the rates be crazy high?",
      a: "Rates are typically 0.5-2% higher than conventional loans. For example, if conventional rates are 6.5%, you might pay 7-8% for a bank statement loan. DSCR loans range from 5.99-8% depending on credit and down payment. Not cheap, but way better than hard money (10-14%)."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I've been self-employed for less than 2 years?",
      a: "DSCR loans don't care how long you've been self-employed since they don't verify income. Bank statement loans typically want 2 years, but some lenders accept 12 months. Asset-based loans are another option if you have significant liquid assets."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use this for my primary residence?",
      a: "DSCR loans are investment properties only. But bank statement loans work for primary residences, second homes, AND investment properties. If you're buying a home to live in, bank statement loans are your best bet."
    },
    {
      q: "What credit score do I need?",
      a: "Most lenders want 620-640 minimum for self-employed loans. Some go as low as 580 but expect higher rates and bigger down payments. If your credit is 700+, you'll get the best rates and terms."
    },
    {
      q: "How much do I need to put down?",
      a: "Typically 15-25% down. DSCR loans usually require 20-25%. Bank statement loans can go as low as 10-15% on primary residences. Investment properties almost always need at least 20% down."

              If you're self-employed and trying to get a mortgage, you've probably discovered that traditional lenders make it unnecessarily complicated. They want 2 years of tax returns, W2s you don't have, and they freak out when they see your business deductions.
