    },
    {
      q: "Can I get approved with a recent bankruptcy or foreclosure?",
      a: "Most lenders want 2-3 years after bankruptcy (Chapter 7) or foreclosure. Chapter 13 can sometimes qualify after 12 months of payments. DSCR loans are more forgiving since they don't verify personal income or credit history as heavily."
    },
    {
      q: "How much will bad credit cost me?",
      a: "Expect to pay 1-2% higher interest rates compared to good credit. On a $500K loan, that's $5,000-$10,000 per year in extra interest. Plus you'll likely need to put more money down (20-30% vs 10-15%)."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I wait to improve my credit first?",
      a: "Depends on your timeline. If you're at 615 and can get to 640 in 3-6 months, probably worth waiting—you'll save $5K-10K/year. If you're at 585 and need 2+ years to hit 640, might make sense to buy now and refinance later."
    },
    {
      q: "Will applying hurt my credit score?",
      a: "Multiple mortgage inquiries within 45 days count as one inquiry. So shop around! The initial credit check will ding you 5-10 points temporarily, but it recovers in 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I refinance later when my credit improves?",
      a: "Yes! Many borrowers with bad credit use non-QM loans to buy, then refinance to conventional once their credit improves. Just make sure your loan doesn't have prepayment penalties."

              Being self-employed with less-than-perfect credit can feel like a double penalty when applying for a mortgage. Traditional lenders are already skeptical of self-employed income, and add bad credit to the mix? Most won't even talk to you.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              But specialized lenders exist specifically for this situation. They offer bank statement loans and DSCR loans that focus on your current income and business cash flow rather than your credit history. While you'll pay slightly higher rates, you CAN get approved—even with credit scores as low as 580.
