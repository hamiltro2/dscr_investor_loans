  {
    question: 'What is the minimum DSCR ratio required in California?',
    answer: 'While we can work with DSCR ratios as low as 0.75, a ratio of 1.0 or higher will get you the best rates and terms. A 1.25 DSCR is considered excellent and qualifies for premium pricing. California\'s high property values often produce strong DSCR ratios due to competitive rental markets.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to close a DSCR loan in California?',
    answer: 'We can close DSCR loans in California in as little as 10-15 business days. The timeline depends on appraisal turnaround (typically 5-7 days in California) and title work. We prioritize California deals and have established relationships with local appraisers and title companies.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get a DSCR loan for an Airbnb or short-term rental in California?',
    answer: 'Yes! California is one of our top markets for short-term rental (STR) DSCR loans. We use a 12-month average of actual rental income for established STRs, or projected income based on AirDNA market reports for new purchases. Palm Springs, San Diego, and Big Bear are particularly strong STR markets.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What down payment is required for a California DSCR loan?',
    answer: 'Minimum down payment is 20-25% depending on the property type and your DSCR ratio. For California properties with strong DSCR ratios (1.25+) and good credit (720+), 20% down is typical. Investment properties in California often appreciate quickly, building equity that can be leveraged for future purchases.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to show tax returns or W-2s for a California DSCR loan?',
    answer: 'No. DSCR loans qualify you based solely on the property\'s rental income, not your personal income. This is perfect for self-employed California investors, business owners, or anyone who wants to scale their portfolio without income documentation limitations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What credit score do I need for a California DSCR loan?',

  },
  {
    question: 'How is rental income calculated for California properties?',

For short-term rentals, we use 12-month actual income average or AirDNA projections. California\'s strong rental market typically supports excellent DSCRs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there prepayment penalties on California DSCR loans?',

  },
  {

    answer: 'Yes. DSCR is calculated as: (Monthly Rental Income) รท (PITIA). California property taxes (typically 1% + special assessments) are included in the PITIA payment. Despite California\'s Prop 13 tax caps, you should factor in potential reassessment upon purchase when calculating your DSCR.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I do a cash-out refinance with a California DSCR loan?',
