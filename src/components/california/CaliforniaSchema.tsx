          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "While we can work with DSCR ratios as low as 0.75, a ratio of 1.0 or higher will get you the best rates and terms. A 1.25 DSCR is considered excellent and qualifies for premium pricing. California's high property values often produce strong DSCR ratios due to competitive rental markets."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "We can close DSCR loans in California in as little as 10-15 business days. The timeline depends on appraisal turnaround (typically 5-7 days in California) and title work. We prioritize California deals and have established relationships with local appraisers and title companies."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes! California is one of our top markets for short-term rental (STR) DSCR loans. We use a 12-month average of actual rental income for established STRs, or projected income based on AirDNA market reports for new purchases. Palm Springs, San Diego, and Big Bear are particularly strong STR markets."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Minimum down payment is 20-25% depending on the property type and your DSCR ratio. For California properties with strong DSCR ratios (1.25+) and good credit (720+), 20% down is typical. Investment properties in California often appreciate quickly, building equity that can be leveraged for future purchases."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes. Most California investors close in an LLC for liability protection. We can close in single-member LLCs, multi-member LLCs, or personal names. California's legal structure makes LLC ownership attractive for rental properties."

Properties must be investment properties (not primary residences). We also finance properties in most California HOAs."

          "text": "For leased properties, we use the lower of current lease or market rent (we can often use the higher amount). For vacant properties, we use 100% of appraiser's market rent. For short-term rentals, we use 12-month actual income average or AirDNA projections. California's strong rental market typically supports excellent DSCRs."
