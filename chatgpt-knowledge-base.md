## DSCR Loan Fundamentals

### What is a DSCR Loan?
A **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) loan** is an investment property mortgage that qualifies you based on the property's cash flow instead of your personal W-2 income. This makes it ideal for:
- Self-employed investors
- High-net-worth individuals with complex tax situations
- Anyone who wants to avoid traditional income documentation
- Portfolio scaling (multiple properties)

### How DSCR is Calculated
**DSCR = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Total Debt Service (PITIA)**

**Components:**
- **NOI:** Monthly rental income (actual or market rent from appraisal)
- **PITIA:** Principal + Interest + Taxes + Insurance + Association fees

**Example:**
- Monthly Rent: $4,000
- Monthly PITIA: $3,000
- DSCR = $4,000 ÷ $3,000 = **1.33** (positive cash flow)

### DSCR Values & What They Mean

| DSCR Value | Meaning | Lender View |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **1.25+** | Strong positive cash flow | Excellent - best rates |
| **1.0-1.24** | Break-even to slight positive | Good - standard approval |
| **0.75-0.99** | Slight negative cash flow | Acceptable with compensating factors |
| **Below 0.75** | Significant negative | Difficult, may need adjustments |

### Minimum & Recommended DSCR Values
- **Minimum:** 0.75 DSCR (with 25-30% down, strong credit 720+)
- **Standard:** 1.0 DSCR (break-even)
- **Recommended:** 1.25+ DSCR (best rates and terms)
- **No Maximum:** Higher is always better

## Strategies to Improve DSCR

### 1. Increase Rental Income
- Raise rents to market rates
- Add bedrooms or bathrooms (ADU, conversion)
- Furnish for higher STR rates
- Add storage, parking, or amenities

### 2. Reduce Monthly Payment (PITIA)

- **Lower interest rate** (shop lenders, improve credit)

- **Extend loan term** (30 years vs 15 years)

### 3. Property Selection
- Buy properties with strong rent-to-price ratios
- Focus on B/C class neighborhoods (better cash flow)
- Avoid luxury properties with poor cash flow

  - Year 1: 5% of loan balance
  - Year 2: 4% of loan balance
  - Year 3: 3% of loan balance
  - Year 4-5: 2-1%
  - After year 5: No penalty

## DSCR Loan Risks & Disadvantages

### Honest Assessment
While DSCR loans are excellent for investors, they do have trade-offs:

**Higher Interest Rates**
- DSCR rates typically 0.5-1.5% higher than conventional
- **Capital Bridge Solutions rates (5.99%+)** are competitive but still higher than owner-occupied mortgages
- Reason: Lenders view investment properties as higher risk

**Prepayment Penalties**
- Most DSCR loans have 3-5 year prepayment penalties
- Can cost 1-5% of loan balance if you refinance early
- **Solution:** Plan to hold 5+ years, or choose no-penalty option (slightly higher rate)

**Larger Down Payments**
- 15-25% down (vs 3-5% for owner-occupied)
- More capital required upfront
- **Capital Bridge Solutions NEW 15% program** helps reduce this burden

**Reserve Requirements**
- Must show 6-12 months PITIA in liquid reserves
- More capital tied up
- Required per property for portfolio investors

**Property Must Cash Flow**
- If property doesn't meet minimum DSCR (0.75+), you won't qualify
- Can't rely on personal income to supplement
- **Solution:** Buy properties with strong rent-to-price ratios

**Limited Lender Options**
- Fewer lenders offer DSCR vs conventional
- May have less negotiating power
- **Capital Bridge Solutions specializes in DSCR** and offers competitive terms

**Not for Primary Residences**
- DSCR is investment property only
- Can't use for your home
- **Use conventional loans for primary residences**

### When DSCR Makes Sense DESPITE These Risks
✅ You're self-employed with write-offs
✅ You have complex tax situations
✅ You're scaling a portfolio quickly
✅ Property cash flows well (1.0+ DSCR)
✅ You plan to hold long-term (5+ years)

**Cash-Out Refinance**
- Pull equity out of rental properties
- **Up to 75% LTV** (leave 25% equity in property)

- Based on property's current appraised value and rental income

**Example Cash-Out Scenario:**
```
Property value: $500,000
Current mortgage: $250,000
Equity: $250,000

Max DSCR cash-out (75% LTV):
- New loan amount: $375,000 (75% of $500K)
- Pay off old loan: $250,000
- Cash to you: $125,000
- Property must still meet DSCR requirements at new payment
```

**Portfolio Refinance**

- Good payment history

**Typical Timeline:**

**When to Refinance:**
- Rates drop 0.5-1%+ below your current rate
- You want to switch from adjustable to fixed
- You need cash for another investment
- You want to remove personal income requirements (switch from conventional)

## Common Objections & Pitfalls

### Objections Investors Raise

**"The rates are too high compared to conventional"**
- **Reality:** Yes, rates are 0.5-1.5% higher
- **Counter:** No tax returns, faster approval, easier to scale portfolio
- **ROI Focus:** Extra 1% on rate = ~$200/month on $400K loan. Worth it if deal still cash flows and you avoid documentation hassle
- **Who it's best for:** Self-employed, portfolio investors, anyone with complex income

**"I don't like prepayment penalties"**
- **Reality:** Most DSCR loans have them (3-5 years)
- **Counter:** Investment properties are typically held 5-10+ years anyway
- **Options:** No-penalty loans available (0.25-0.5% higher rate)
- **Plan ahead:** If you might sell/refi in 2-3 years, factor penalty into your deal analysis

**"My property doesn't cash flow enough"**
- **Reality:** Need 0.75-1.0+ DSCR to qualify
- **Solutions:**
  - Increase down payment (lowers payment, raises DSCR)
  - Raise rents to market rates
  - Buy in better cash-flow markets
  - Consider fix-and-flip loan first, then DSCR refi after value-add

**"I need more than 75% LTV"**
- **Reality:** DSCR loans max at 75-80% LTV (20-25% down)
- **Counter:** Lower leverage = better cash flow and less risk
- **NEW:** Capital Bridge Solutions 15% down program (85% LTV) for qualified buyers

**"I heard DSCR loans are hard to get"**
- **Reality:** They're actually EASIER than conventional (no tax returns, no DTI)
- **Confusion:** People confuse DSCR with hard money or commercial loans
- **Education:** DSCR is simpler documentation than traditional mortgages

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Not Accounting for Vacancy**
- **Pitfall:** Using 100% gross rent in DSCR calculation
- **Reality:** Lenders use market rent, but YOU should factor 5-10% vacancy in YOUR analysis
- **Fix:** Make sure deal works at 1.25+ DSCR to have buffer

**2. Ignoring Reserves**
- **Pitfall:** Using all cash for down payment, forgetting reserves
- **Reality:** Need 6-12 months PITIA in bank AFTER closing
- **Fix:** Plan for 30-35% of purchase price in total cash (down + closing + reserves)

**3. Buying Negative Cash Flow Properties**
- **Pitfall:** Assuming personal income can supplement (like conventional)
- **Reality:** DSCR lenders don't care about your income—property must stand alone
- **Fix:** Only buy properties with 1.0+ DSCR (ideally 1.25+)

**4. Overleveraging**
- **Pitfall:** Buying too many properties too fast without reserves
- **Reality:** One bad tenant across 5 properties can sink your portfolio
- **Fix:** Build 12+ months reserves per property before buying next one

**5. Ignoring Prepayment Penalty**
- **Pitfall:** Planning to refinance in 2 years, forgetting about penalty
- **Reality:** Could cost $20K+ on a $500K loan
- **Fix:** Factor penalty into hold strategy or choose no-penalty option

**6. Not Shopping Lenders**
- **Pitfall:** Taking first DSCR offer without comparing
- **Reality:** Rates and terms vary widely (5.99% vs 8%+)
- **Fix:** Capital Bridge Solutions offers competitive rates—compare us to your other options

**7. Weak Due Diligence on Rent Comps**
- **Pitfall:** Assuming inflated rents will appraise
- **Reality:** Appraisers use conservative rent estimates
- **Fix:** Research 3-5 comparable rentals in area, use conservative numbers

**8. Forgetting About Property Management Costs**
- **Pitfall:** Calculating DSCR without property management fee
- **Reality:** Most investors use PM (8-10% of rent)
- **Fix:** Lenders may not require it, but YOU should factor it into YOUR analysis

## Understanding DSCR - Simple Explanations

### "Explain Like I'm Five" - What is DSCR?

**The Lemonade Stand Analogy:**
Imagine you want to borrow money to buy a lemonade stand.

- The bank asks: **"Can this lemonade stand make enough money to pay me back?"**
- They DON'T ask about your allowance or how much your parents make
- They ONLY care: **Does the stand make more than the loan payment?**

**That's DSCR!**
- If the stand makes **$100/month** and the payment is **$80/month**, your DSCR is **1.25** (good!)
- If the stand makes **$80/month** and the payment is **$80/month**, your DSCR is **1.0** (break-even)
- If the stand makes **$60/month** and the payment is **$80/month**, your DSCR is **0.75** (losing money)

**For rental properties:**
- Replace "lemonade stand" with "rental house"
- Replace "lemonade sales" with "monthly rent"
- Replace "payment" with "mortgage + taxes + insurance"

### Key Concepts Made Simple

**Why DSCR Loans Exist:**
Traditional banks want to know about YOUR job and income. But what if:
- You're self-employed and write off everything?
- You have rental income from 10 properties but it "looks" small on tax returns?
- You don't want to show 2 years of tax returns?

**DSCR loans say:** "We don't care about YOUR money. We care about the PROPERTY's money."

**The Magic Formula:**
```
DSCR = Money Coming In ÷ Money Going Out

Money In = Monthly Rent
Money Out = Mortgage + Taxes + Insurance + HOA

DSCR > 1.0 = Property makes money ✅
DSCR = 1.0 = Property breaks even ⚠️
DSCR < 1.0 = Property loses money ❌
```

### Quick Decision Guide

**"Should I use a DSCR loan or conventional?"**
- Use DSCR if: Self-employed, high DTI, want to scale portfolio, value speed/simplicity
- Use conventional if: W-2 employee with clean DTI, buying primary residence, seeking absolute lowest rate

**"Should I use DSCR or hard money?"**
- Use DSCR if: Property is rent-ready, holding 5+ years, want competitive rates
- Use hard money if: Major rehab needed, fix-and-flip, need 100% financing, very fast close

**"Can I use DSCR for my first rental property?"**
- YES, but you'll need: 640+ credit, 20-25% down (15% with our program), 6-12 months reserves
- First-time investor friendly at Capital Bridge Solutions

**"Can I use DSCR to scale to 10+ properties?"**
- YES! This is DSCR's superpower. No DTI means unlimited scaling (with sufficient reserves)
