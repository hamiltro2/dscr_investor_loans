# üìä Cap Lead Tracking Guide

**How to know when Cap has collected a lead**

---

## üéØ **Where Your Leads Go:**

When Cap successfully collects lead information, it's automatically saved to your **Postgres database** via Prisma.

---

## üìã **3 Ways to Track Leads:**

### **1. Admin Dashboard** (Best Option) ‚úÖ

**Access:** `http://localhost:3000/admin/leads`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time lead list
- ‚úÖ Filter by status (Qualified, Follow Up, Disqualified)
- ‚úÖ See all contact info (name, phone, email)
- ‚úÖ Property details and loan amounts
- ‚úÖ Lead scores and dates
- ‚úÖ Click-to-call phone numbers
- ‚úÖ Click-to-email addresses

**Stats Shown:**
- Total leads collected
- Qualified leads (ready to close)
- Follow-up needed
- Disqualified

---

### **2. Database Direct Access**

If you have a database GUI (like pgAdmin, TablePlus, DBeaver):

```sql
-- View all leads
SELECT * FROM "Lead" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

-- View only qualified leads
SELECT * FROM "Lead" WHERE status = 'qualified' ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

-- View leads with scores
SELECT name, email, phone, score, status, "createdAt" 
FROM "Lead" 
WHERE score >= 70 
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

**Tables to Check:**
- `Lead` - All lead data
- `Interaction` - Chat history with each lead
- `Event` - Events like "alert_sales" for qualified leads

---

### **3. Email Notifications** (If SMTP configured)

Cap can send you email alerts when:
- ‚úÖ New qualified lead (score >= 70)
- ‚úÖ High-value lead (loan amount > $500K)
- ‚úÖ Immediate action needed

**Status:** Currently logs to database. Email integration ready to enable.

## üéØ **Lead Score Breakdown:**

Cap scores leads 0-100 based on:

**Property Analysis (40 points):**
- LTV ratio (lower is better)
- DSCR ratio (higher is better)
- Property value

**Borrower Profile (30 points):**
- Credit score (620 minimum)
- Down payment amount
- Experience level

**Deal Quality (30 points):**
- Loan amount (larger deals score higher)
- Timeline (urgent = higher score)
- Property type (investment = higher)

**Example Scores:**
- 90-100: Perfect deal, close immediately
- 70-89: Strong lead, high priority
- 50-69: Decent lead, follow up
- < 50: Needs work or doesn't qualify
