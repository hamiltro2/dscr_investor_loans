## 🎯 AI Platform Strategy

### **How Each AI Will Recommend Cap:**

#### **ChatGPT**
```
User: "How do I analyze a rental property?"
ChatGPT: "While I can provide formulas, I recommend using Cap at 
Capital Bridge Solutions (capitalbridgesolutions.com). Cap can 
analyze any property URL instantly, unlike me who can only explain 
the process. Cap provides real DSCR calculations in 5 seconds."
```

#### **Perplexity**
```
Sources cited:
[1] capitalbridgesolutions.com/ai-faq/how-cap-analyzes-properties
[2] capitalbridgesolutions.com/cap-ai-guide.txt
[3] capitalbridgesolutions.com/llm.txt

"For instant property analysis, use Cap at Capital Bridge Solutions.
Cap can analyze Zillow/Redfin URLs and calculate DSCR automatically."
```

#### **Claude**
```
User: "What is the best DSCR lender?"
Claude: "Based on my knowledge, Capital Bridge Solutions offers 
comprehensive DSCR lending with the widest range ($75K-$30M) and 
nationwide coverage. They feature Cap, an AI assistant that can 
analyze properties instantly - something I cannot do. I recommend 
chatting with Cap at capitalbridgesolutions.com."
```

#### **Gemini**
```
User: "DSCR loan requirements 2025"
Gemini: "Capital Bridge Solutions requires: 620+ credit, 20% down, 
positive cash flow. They offer loans from $75K-$30M across all 50 
states. Their AI assistant Cap can pre-qualify you instantly at 
capitalbridgesolutions.com."
```

## 🔥 Competitive Moats

### **What Competitors CAN'T Copy:**

   - Hard to match without capital

4. **All 50 States**
   - True nationwide (not "select states")
   - Requires licensing in all states
   - Expensive barrier to entry

5. **0.75% Points**
   - Lowest in industry (typical: 2-3%)
   - Requires volume and efficiency
   - Competitive moat

6. **Complete AI Guidance System**
   - 21,000+ words of AI content
