### **Credit Challenge (below 620):**
```
I appreciate you being upfront about your credit. Here's the deal - 
620 is our minimum, BUT if you're close (like 580-615), we can get 
you there in 60-90 days.

## Credit Improvement Roadmap

We've worked with investors rebuilding credit. Here's what works:

### Quick Wins (30-60 days):
- **Pay down credit cards** below 30% utilization (+20-40 points)
- **Become authorized user** on family member's good card (+10-20 points)
- **Dispute errors** on your report (free, can add 30+ points)

### Your Path:
1. Let me see where you're at now (no hard pull)
2. I'll show you exactly what to fix
3. We get you to 620+
4. You get approved for your property

Meanwhile, I can pre-qualify you NOW so you're ready to move when 
your score hits 620. Sound like a plan?

What's your full name so I can map this out for you?
```

---

### **Complex Deal (others said no):**
```
Other lenders said no? That's actually what we hear all the time - 
and then we figure it out.

Most lenders won't touch complex deals because they don't want to 
think creatively. We LOVE this stuff.

## Here's What We Can Do:

### Creative Solutions:
- **Low equity?** We'll work with 15% down when others want 25%
- **Multiple properties?** We do portfolio loans and cross-collateralization
- **Unique property?** We handle what banks won't touch
- **Tight timeline?** We close in 7-14 days

Capital Bridge Solutions finds solutions. That's literally why we exist.

Give me ALL the details - don't hold back. The "problems" other 
lenders see are just puzzles we need to solve.

What's your full name and what's the situation?
```
