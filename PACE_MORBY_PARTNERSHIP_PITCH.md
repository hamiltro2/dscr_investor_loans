# **"Pace By Your Side"**
## AI Creative Finance Coach - Partnership Proposal

---

## **üéØ The Vision:**

**"What if every student who bought your course had Pace Morby available 24/7 to answer questions, analyze deals, and guide them through their first SubTo deal?"**

That's **Pace By Your Side** - an AI companion trained on YOUR methodology, YOUR voice, YOUR deal structures. It's you, scaled infinitely.

---

## **üìä The Problem (That Pace Already Knows):**

**Your students are stuck:**
- ‚úÖ They bought the course
- ‚úÖ They understand the concepts
- ‚úÖ BUT... when they find a property at 10pm, they freeze

**The questions that keep them from taking action:**
- "Is this seller motivated enough for SubTo?"
- "What should I offer on this deal?"
- "How do I calculate the equity position?"
- "What if the seller says X, what do I say?"
- "Is this a good deal or am I being desperate?"

**Right now:** They post in Facebook, wait 6 hours, deal is gone.

**With Pace By Your Side:** They get answers in 30 seconds, make the offer that night, close the deal.

---

## **üí° What "Pace By Your Side" Does:**

### **1. Analyzes Creative Finance Deals (SubTo, Seller Finance, Wraps)**
```
Student: "Found a house - $450K value, seller owes $380K, distressed, 
needs to move fast. SubTo deal?"

Pace: "Let's run it. That's $70K in equity. Here's the play:
- Offer to take over payments ($2,400/mo existing mortgage)
- They walk with $10K cash at closing (covers moving costs)
- You control $450K property for basically $10K
- Rent it for $3,200/mo = $800/mo cash flow
- Equity capture: $70K

This is a TEXTBOOK SubTo deal. Here's your script for the seller..."
```

### **2. Teaches Pace's Methodology in Real-Time**
- Seller motivation scripts
- Objection handling ("What if they ask about due-on-sale?")
- Deal structuring (SubTo vs Seller Finance vs Wrap)
- Exit strategies
- How to talk to title companies

### **3. Qualification & Negotiation Coaching**
```
Student: "Seller is hesitant about SubTo because of the due-on-sale clause"

Pace: "Classic objection. Here's what I tell them:
'Mr. Seller, banks call loans when payments STOP, not when ownership 
changes. I'm taking OVER your payments - making them on time, every time. 
The bank gets paid, you get relief, everyone wins. In 20 years of doing 
these deals, I've never had a bank call a loan when payments are current.'

Want me to walk you through the rest of the conversation?"
```

### **4. Captures Leads for Pace's Business**
- Students who need funding (partner with Pace's lenders)
- Students ready for coaching/mastermind upsell
- Deal opportunities Pace could partner on
- Testimonials/success stories

---

## **üöÄ How It Works (Student Journey):**

### **Step 1: Student Finds Deal**
Drives by property, sees "For Sale By Owner" sign at 9pm

### **Step 2: Opens "Pace By Your Side"**
- Web app or mobile
- Voice chat or text
- Available 24/7

### **Step 3: Analyzes Deal Together**
```
Pace: "Tell me about the property. What's the address and what 
do you know about the seller's situation?"

Student: [Explains]

Pace: "Got it. Let me pull the property data..."
[Analyzes value, mortgage balance, equity, comps]

"Okay, here's what we're working with. This could work as a SubTo 
if the seller is motivated. Let's figure out your offer structure..."
```

### **Step 4: Gets Action Plan**
- Exact offer structure
- Seller conversation script
- Objection handling
- Next steps checklist

### **Step 5: Takes Action That Night**
Calls seller, makes offer, books appointment - because they have **confidence**

## **üìà Revenue Model (Win-Win-Win):**

### **For Students:**
- **$47/month** subscription (cheap compared to $1997 course)
- Or **included free** with Pace's course (increases course value)
- Or **tiered**: Basic (free with course) ‚Üí Pro ($47/mo) ‚Üí Elite ($97/mo with live deal reviews)

### **For Pace:**
**Immediate Revenue:**
- 10,000 active students √ó $47/mo = **$470K/month**
- Or boost course sales: "Buy course, get Pace By Your Side FREE for 90 days"

**Long-Term Value:**
- Upsell to coaching ($30K/year)
- Capture deal flow (JV opportunities)
- Lender partnerships (referral fees)
- Keep students engaged longer (reduce churn)

### **For Me (Partnership Structure):**

**Option 1: Revenue Share**
- 50/50 split on subscription revenue
- I build, maintain, improve the AI
- Pace provides brand, methodology, promotion

**Option 2: License Fee**
- Pace pays $X/month licensing fee
- Owns the product completely
- I provide technical support

**Option 3: Equity Partnership**
- Create joint venture entity
- Pace: Brand, audience, methodology (60%)
- Me: Technology, development, maintenance (40%)
- Scale together

## **üéØ Why This Works for Pace:**

### **1. Scales Your Impact**
- Help 10,000 students simultaneously
- Answer questions 24/7 without hiring staff
- Students succeed faster = better testimonials

### **2. Increases Course Value**
"Buy my course and get **Pace By Your Side** - your personal AI coach available 24/7 to help you close your first deal."

**That's a $5,000 value perception for a $47/mo cost.**

### **3. Reduces Support Burden**
- Facebook group has 50,000+ members
- Can't possibly answer everyone
- AI handles 90% of common questions
- You focus on high-level strategy

### **4. Creates Sticky Recurring Revenue**
- Students pay monthly to keep access
- Reduces refund requests (they're getting ongoing value)
- Creates community momentum (everyone using same tool)

### **5. Captures Deal Flow**
```
When student analyzes a deal worth $2M+ equity:
"This deal is too big for a beginner. Want me to connect you 
with Pace's team to potentially partner on this?"
```
**Instant JV opportunities.**

### **6. Differentiates From Competition**
- Grant Cardone doesn't have this
- Ryan Pineda doesn't have this
- Kris Krohn doesn't have this
- **Pace Morby does** = competitive moat

## **‚ùì FAQ (What Pace Might Ask):**

**Q: "Won't this replace me?"**  
A: No. It makes you MORE valuable. Students get basic answers instantly, then they're READY for your high-level coaching. You focus on masterminds and big deals, not "How do I calculate ARV?" questions.

**Q: "What if the AI gives bad advice?"**  
A: We add disclaimers, train it conservatively, and build in "talk to a human" escalation for complex deals. Plus, you review and approve all methodology before launch.

**Q: "How is this different from ChatGPT?"**  
A: ChatGPT is generic. This is trained specifically on YOUR methodology, YOUR voice, YOUR market. It knows creative finance deeply. And it captures leads for your business.

**Q: "What's my time commitment?"**  
A: Minimal. 5 hours upfront for knowledge transfer, then 1 hour/month reviewing and improving. I handle everything else.

**Q: "What if it doesn't work?"**  
A: We build in phases. Beta test with 100 students first. If they don't love it, we pivot or kill it. Low risk, high reward.

## **üî• The Bottom Line:**

**Pace, you've built an empire teaching people creative finance. But there's a gap:**

**Between someone buying your course and closing their first deal, they need a coach. They need confidence. They need YOU available at 10pm when they find a deal.**

**Pace By Your Side solves that.**

**It's you, scaled infinitely. It's your methodology, available 24/7. It's the difference between students who "learned a lot" and students who CLOSED DEALS.**

**And it generates $2M+ in recurring revenue while helping more people than you ever could alone.**

**Let's build this together.** üêäüöÄ

## **üìé Appendix: Sample Conversation (Pace By Your Side)**

```
Student: "Hey Pace, I found a property. Not sure if it's a good SubTo deal."

Pace: "Let's break it down! Tell me what you know about the property 
and the seller's situation."

Student: "3bed/2bath, worth $380K, seller owes $310K, needs to move 
for a job in 30 days, listed for $360K but no offers yet."

Pace: "Okay, here's what I'm seeing:
- Equity position: $70K ($380K value - $310K owed)
- Motivated seller: Job relocation in 30 days = HIGH motivation
- No offers: Means they're flexible
- Listed below value: Tells me they need speed over profit

This is SubTo material. Here's your play:

OFFER STRUCTURE:
- Take over existing mortgage payments ($2,100/mo estimated)
- Give them $5K-$10K cash at closing (helps with move)
- Close in 7-14 days (beats any conventional buyer)
- You control $380K property for $10K out of pocket

YOUR CASH FLOW:
- Rent for $2,600/mo (I just checked comps)
- Mortgage payment: $2,100/mo
- Cash flow: $500/mo
- Equity capture: $70K

NEXT STEPS:
1. Call them TODAY
2. Use my motivation script: 'Mr. Seller, I can solve your problem...'
3. Book a walkthrough for tomorrow
4. Make the offer in person

Want me to walk you through the exact seller conversation?"

Student: "Yes! What do I say?"

Pace: "Here's your script..."
```

**That's the experience. That's the value. That's Pace By Your Side.** üéØ
