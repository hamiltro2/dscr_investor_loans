### Resource Page Outreach

Subject: Free DSCR Calculator for [Website] Investors

Hi [Name],

I was researching investment property financing resources and came across your helpful tools page at [URL].

We recently launched a free DSCR loan calculator that helps real estate investors instantly check their eligibility for investment property loans based on rental income (not personal income).

[Link to calculator]

Over 3,500 investors have used it to secure financing for rentals and Airbnbs. Would this be valuable for your readers?

Happy to provide any additional details.

Best,

### Guest Post Pitch
```
Subject: Article Idea: Financing Airbnb Properties Without W-2 Income

Hi [Editor name],

I've been following [Website] for insights on real estate investing - your recent piece on [specific article] was particularly helpful.

I'd love to contribute an article on how investors are using DSCR loans to finance Airbnb properties without traditional income verification. 

The article would cover:
- What DSCR loans are and how they work
- Why they're ideal for STR properties  
- Step-by-step qualification process
- Real examples with numbers

I'm the [title] at Capital Bridge Solutions, where we've helped 3,500+ investors secure over $500M in investment property financing.

Would this topic interest your readers?

Best,

### Partner Outreach
```
Subject: Partnership Opportunity - [Their Company] x Capital Bridge

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Their Company] helps real estate investors with [their service]. We help those same investors secure financing for rental properties through DSCR loans.

I think there's a great opportunity for us to refer clients to each other. 

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss how we could partner? I have some ideas on how we could create value for both of our client bases.

Best,
[Your name]
