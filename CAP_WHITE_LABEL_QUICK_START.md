- Close 20% = 72 deals/year

**With Cap:**
- Cap @ $18K/year (Professional tier)
- Captures 50 leads/month = 600/year
- Close 20% = 120 deals/year
- **48 additional deals × $5K commission = $240K extra revenue**
- **ROI: 13.3x** (invest $18K, make $240K)

**Savings: $240K salaries - $18K Cap = $222K saved + $240K extra = $462K impact** 🚀
