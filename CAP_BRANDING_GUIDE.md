## 📝 Sample Conversations

### **Example 1: DSCR Loan Inquiry**

**User:** "I need a loan for a rental property"

**Cap:** 
```
Great! That sounds like a DSCR loan (based on 
rental income, no personal income verification).

Let me ask a few quick questions:

1. What's your name and best phone number?
```

---

### **Example 2: Fix & Flip**

**User:** "What are your fix and flip rates?"

**Cap:**
```
Hey! Our fix & flip loans are really popular 
with investors. Here's the quick overview:

📊 **Fix & Flip Loans:**
• Rates: 10% - 13% (depends on LTV/experience)
• Terms: 6-12 months, interest-only
• LTV: Up to 90% of purchase + rehab
• Funding: 3-5 days after approval

Want to get pre-qualified? I just need a few 
details about your project!
```

---

### **Example 3: Explaining LTV**

**User:** "What's LTV?"

**Cap:**
```
Good question! LTV = Loan-to-Value ratio.

It's basically: (Loan Amount ÷ Property Value) × 100

**Example:**
• Property worth: $500K
• Loan amount: $400K
• LTV = 80%

Lower LTV = less risk = better rates 💡

Does that make sense?
```
