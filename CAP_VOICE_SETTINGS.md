## üîß How to Change Cap's Voice

### **Option 1: Quick Change**

Edit these two files:

**1. API Route** (`src/app/api/voice/speak/route.ts`):
```typescript
const { text, voice = 'echo' } = await req.json();
//                    ^^^^^^ Change this
```

**2. Chat Widget** (`src/components/AIChat/ChatWidget.tsx`):
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({ text, voice: 'echo' }),
//                                  ^^^^^^ Change this
```

**Available options:**
- `'echo'` - Natural conversational male (current)
- `'nova'` - Energetic conversational female
- `'onyx'` - Deep authoritative male
- `'alloy'` - Neutral balanced (previous)
- `'fable'` - British male
- `'shimmer'` - Gentle female

### **Option 2: Make it User-Selectable** (Future)

Add a voice picker in the chat settings:
```typescript
const [selectedVoice, setSelectedVoice] = useState('echo');

// In settings menu:
<select value={selectedVoice} onChange={(e) => setSelectedVoice(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="echo">Echo (Male, Natural)</option>
  <option value="nova">Nova (Female, Energetic)</option>
  <option value="onyx">Onyx (Male, Deep)</option>
</select>
```
