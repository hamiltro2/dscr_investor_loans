## 🔧 How It Works (Technical)

### **Email Flow:**
```
User → Cap collects info → Gets consent
  ↓
Cap saves to database
  ↓
Cap scores lead (preliminary offer)
  ↓
🚀 sendCapLeadNotification() fires
  ↓
Email sent to: hamiltro2@hotmail.com, erolsenel11@gmail.com
  ↓
Your team gets notified instantly!
```

### **Files Involved:**
- `src/lib/email.ts` - Email function
- `src/constants/prompts.ts` - Cap's conversation (updated)
- `src/app/api/test-email/route.ts` - Test endpoint
- `.env.local` - SMTP credentials (secure)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Gmail App Password:**
✅ You're using: `drbh tsbt cnne dhfa`
- This is a Gmail "App Password" (correct!)
- More secure than your regular password
- Specific to this application

### **Email Deliverability:**
- ✅ Gmail SMTP is reliable
- ✅ Both recipients will receive
- ⚠️ Check spam folder first time
- ⚠️ Add ricardohamiltonmd@gmail.com to contacts

### **Testing Best Practices:**
1. Test with sample data first ✅
2. Verify both recipients get it ✅
3. Check HTML formatting ✅
4. Test on mobile device 📱
5. Save to favorites (not spam) ⭐

## 📊 Monitoring

### **Check Email Logs:**
Look in terminal when server runs:
```
[Email] Cap lead notification sent successfully
```

Or errors:
```
[Email] Error sending Cap lead notification: [details]
```

### **Common Issues:**
1. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check App Password is correct
   - Verify 2FA is enabled on Gmail

2. **"Connection timeout"**
   - Check firewall/antivirus
   - Port 465 must be open

3. **"Emails go to spam"**
   - Add sender to contacts
   - Mark as "Not Spam"
   - First few emails may go to spam

---
