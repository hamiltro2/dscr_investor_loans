## 🚀 How to Test

### **Step 1: Start the Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

---

### **Step 2: Test Improved UI**

1. **Click the chat bubble** (bottom-right)
2. **Check visibility:**
   - ✅ Can you read the AI's message clearly?
   - ✅ Is the background dark enough?
   - ✅ Are message bubbles well-defined?
   - ✅ Is the input field visible?

---

### **Step 3: Test Voice Input (Speech-to-Text)**

1. **Click the microphone button** 🎤
2. **Allow microphone access** (browser will prompt)
3. **Speak clearly:**
   ```
   "I need a DSCR loan for a rental property"
   ```
4. **Click microphone again** to stop recording
5. **Wait 2-3 seconds** for transcription
6. **Check the input field** - your speech should appear as text!
7. **Click Send** ➤ to submit

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Mic button turns red and pulses while recording
- ✅ Input field says "Listening..."
- ✅ Transcription appears after stopping
- ✅ Accuracy is good (may vary with background noise)

---

### **Step 4: Test Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)**

1. **Send any message** (type or voice)
2. **Wait for AI response**
3. **Listen** - AI should speak the response automatically!
4. **Check speaker icon** at bottom (should show "On")

**What to Listen For:**
- ✅ Clear, natural voice (Alloy voice)
- ✅ Proper pronunciation
- ✅ Smooth playback
- ✅ Not too fast or slow

---

### **Step 5: Test Voice Toggle**

1. **Click "On" button** next to speaker icon 🔊
2. Should change to "Off"
3. **Send a message** - AI should NOT speak
4. **Click "Off"** to turn back on
5. **Send another message** - AI should speak again

**What to Check:**
- ✅ Toggle works immediately
- ✅ Voice stops if playing when disabled
- ✅ Preference persists during session

---

### **Step 6: Test Full Conversation Flow**

Try this complete voice conversation:

**You (voice):** "Hi, I need financing for a rental property"

**AI:** Asks about property details

**You (voice):** "It's a single family home in Sacramento, I want to borrow $400,000"

**AI:** Asks for more details (rental income, etc.)

**You (voice):** "Monthly rent is $3,200"

**AI:** Calculates DSCR, asks for consent

**You (type):** "yes"

**AI:** Saves lead, provides preliminary offer, speaks results!

**Expected Flow:**
- ✅ Voice input works consistently
- ✅ AI responses are spoken automatically
- ✅ Conversation feels natural
- ✅ Can mix voice and text input
- ✅ Lead gets saved to Supabase

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Microphone Not Working**

**Symptoms:**
- Button doesn't turn red
- No transcription appears
- Browser doesn't ask for permission

**Solutions:**
1. **Check HTTPS:** Voice input requires HTTPS (or localhost)
2. **Browser permissions:** Go to site settings, allow microphone
3. **Check console:** Look for errors (F12 → Console)
4. **Try different browser:** Chrome/Edge work best

---

### **Issue: No Voice Output**

**Symptoms:**
- AI responds but doesn't speak
- Speaker icon shows "On" but no audio

**Solutions:**
1. **Check speaker toggle:** Make sure it says "On"
2. **Check volume:** Device volume not muted
3. **Check console:** Look for TTS API errors
4. **Check API key:** Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
5. **Browser autoplay:** Some browsers block autoplay (click play manually)

---

### **Issue: Transcription Inaccurate**

**Symptoms:**
- Wrong words transcribed
- Gibberish or nonsense

**Solutions:**
1. **Speak clearly and slowly**
2. **Reduce background noise**
3. **Use a better microphone** (headset vs laptop mic)
4. **Check language:** Currently set to English
5. **Pause between sentences**

---

### **Issue: Voice Responses Too Long**

**Symptoms:**
- TTS takes forever to play
- Voice cuts off mid-sentence

**Solutions:**
1. **Check AI responses:** May be too verbose
2. **Adjust system prompt:** Make responses more concise
3. **Check TTS limits:** 4000 character max (automatically truncated)
