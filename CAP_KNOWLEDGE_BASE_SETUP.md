# 🧠 Cap's Knowledge Base - RAG System Implementation

**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Infrastructure Ready  
**Next:** Build knowledge base, add tool to Cap, enhance conversation flow

---

## 📋 What We Built

### **Phase 1: RAG Infrastructure** ✅

1. **Knowledge Base Library** (`src/lib/knowledge-base.ts`)
   - Search function using vector similarity
   - Cosine similarity algorithm
   - Knowledge chunk interface
   - Result formatting for Cap

2. **Build Script** (`scripts/build-knowledge-base.ts`)
   - Extracts content from all 31 blog articles
   - Generates embeddings using OpenAI
   - Chunks long articles for better retrieval
   - Saves to `knowledge-base.json`

3. **Updated Files:**
   - ✅ `package.json` - Added `build:knowledge` script
   - ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes generated knowledge base
   - ✅ `src/app/api/agent/chat/route.ts` - Import added (tool integration pending)

---

## 🎯 Current Status

### **✅ Complete:**
- Knowledge base search infrastructure
- Blog article indexer with 25 articles mapped
- Embedding generation system
- Vector similarity search
- Build automation

### **🔄 In Progress:**
- Running the build script to generate knowledge base
- Adding searchKnowledgeBase tool to Cap
- Enhanced system prompt with conversation flow

### **📝 Pending:**
- Tool integration in chat API
- Conversation flow updates
- Testing and refinement

---

## 🚀 Next Steps - What YOU Need to Do

### **Step 1: Build the Knowledge Base**

Run this command to index all your blog articles:

```bash
npm run build:knowledge
```

**What this does:**
- Reads all 31 blog article files
- Extracts main content
- Splits long articles into chunks
- Generates embeddings (costs ~$0.02-0.05)
- Saves to `knowledge-base.json` (~5-10MB file)

**Expected output:**
```
🔨 Building Knowledge Base...

📄 Processing: DSCR Loans with 620 Credit Score
   ✓ Extracted 2 chunk(s)
📄 Processing: Airbnb DSCR Loans in California
   ✓ Extracted 3 chunk(s)
...

📦 Total chunks created: 85
🔮 Generating embeddings...
   Processing batch 1/1

✅ Knowledge base saved to: knowledge-base.json
📊 Statistics:
   - Articles processed: 25
   - Total chunks: 85
   - Chunks with embeddings: 85

🎉 Knowledge base build complete!
```

---

### **Step 2: Test Knowledge Search (Optional)**

Create a test script to verify it works:

```typescript
// test-knowledge-search.ts
import { searchKnowledgeBase, formatKnowledgeResults } from './src/lib/knowledge-base';

async function test() {
  const results = await searchKnowledgeBase(
    "Can I get a DSCR loan with 620 credit score?",
    3
  );
  
  console.log(formatKnowledgeResults(results));
}

test();
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Blog Articles → Knowledge Base:**

```
31 Blog Articles
       ↓
Extract content from page.tsx files
       ↓
Split into chunks (~800 chars each)
       ↓
Generate embeddings (OpenAI)
       ↓
Store in knowledge-base.json
       ↓
Load into memory when Cap starts
```

### **When Investor Asks Question:**

```
Investor: "Can I get a loan with 620 credit?"
       ↓
Cap calls searchKnowledgeBase()
       ↓
Generate query embedding
       ↓
Calculate similarity to all chunks
       ↓
Return top 3 most relevant
       ↓
Cap uses context to answer
       ↓
"Yes! Based on our guide... [detailed answer]"
```

## 🎯 Phase 2: Enable the Tool (Next Session)

Once you've built the knowledge base, we'll:

### **1. Add Tool to Cap's API**

Update `src/app/api/agent/chat/route.ts` to include:

```typescript
tools: [
  {
    type: 'function',
    function: {
      name: 'searchKnowledgeBase',
      description: 'Search Capital Bridge Solutions knowledge base for detailed information about DSCR loans, requirements, rates, and investor scenarios.',
      parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          query: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'Search query (e.g., "620 credit score requirements", "Airbnb short-term rental loans")',
          },
          topK: {
            type: 'number',
            description: 'Number of results to return (default: 3)',
          },
        },
        required: ['query'],
      },
    },
  },
  // ... other tools
]
```

### **2. Handle Tool Call**

```typescript
case 'searchKnowledgeBase': {
  const { query, topK = 3 } = JSON.parse(toolCall.arguments);
  const results = await searchKnowledgeBase(query, topK);
  result = formatKnowledgeResults(results);
  break;
}
```

## 🎨 Phase 3: Enhanced Conversation Flow

We'll update Cap's system prompt to:

### **Before (Current):**
```
You: Lead capture bot
Goal: Get contact info fast
Flow: Ask 5-7 questions → Qualify → Schedule
```

### **After (Enhanced):**
```
You: Investor advisor & lead qualifier
Goal: Educate, build trust, THEN qualify
Flow: Answer questions → Show expertise → Qualify → Schedule

Example:
Investor: "Can I get a loan with 620 credit?"
Cap: [Searches knowledge base]
     "Yes! According to our comprehensive guide,
      you can qualify with 620 credit score. Here's what matters:
      
      ✓ Property must cash flow (1.0+ DSCR)
      ✓ Rates typically 6.5-7.5%
      ✓ We specialize in this credit range
      ✓ No tax returns needed
      
      Want me to check if your property qualifies?"
```
